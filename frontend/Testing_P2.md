# P2 Manual Testing Plan — Production Integration & Real Features

## P2 Strategy

**Build order:** Channel Management → File Uploads (OSS) → WebSocket (Fly.io) → Resend Email → Backend Integration (last)

**Why backend integration last?** We build and self-test everything first using simulated webhooks. Once file uploads and real-time are working, we hand the backend team a complete, tested API spec. No back-and-forth, no spec changes mid-build.

**Self-testing approach:** Use webhook.site (or local test endpoint) as `BACKEND_WEBHOOK_URL` to capture and inspect all outgoing payloads. Use `test-sync.ts` to simulate all incoming backend calls. Full round-trip testing without the backend team.

## Prerequisites

### Already Set Up (from P0/P1)

- App running on localhost:3000
- Default admin: `admin@creatorhub.local` / `admin123`
- Test accounts: creator1, mod1, supermod1 (promoted via Settings > Admin > Users)
- Task and discussion channels exist from seed

### New Setup Required for P2

#### 1. Resend Email (Section 5a)

- [x] Create a free Resend account at https://resend.com
- [x] Generate an API key from Resend dashboard
- [x] Add to `.env`:

```
  RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxx
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

- [ ] (Optional) Verify a custom sending domain in Resend for production

#### 2. Aliyun OSS (Section 3 — File Uploads)

- [x] Create an Aliyun account and enable OSS service
- [x] Create an OSS bucket (e.g. `contenthub-uploads`)
- [x] Configure CORS on the bucket:
  - Allowed Origins: `http://localhost:3000`, `https://your-production-domain.com`
  - Allowed Methods: `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `HEAD`
  - Allowed Headers: `*`
  - Expose Headers: `ETag`
  - Max Age: `3600`
- [x] Create a RAM user with `AliyunOSSFullAccess` policy
- [x] Generate AccessKey ID and AccessKey Secret
- [x] Add to `.env`:

```
  OSS_REGION=oss-cn-beijing
  OSS_BUCKET=contenthub-uploads
  OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
  OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=your-access-key-secret
  OSS_ENDPOINT=https://oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com
```

#### 3. Backend Integration (Section 4) — Self-Test First, Real Integration Last

- [x] Go to https://webhook.site — copy your unique URL
- [x] Add to `.env`:

#### 4. WebSocket / Real-Time (Section 5) — Socket.io on Fly.io

- [x] Install Fly CLI: `curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh`
- [x] Create Fly.io account at https://fly.io
- [x] From `ws-server/` directory: `fly launch` (choose "Launch from your machine", Singapore)
- [x] Set secrets on Fly.io:

```
  fly secrets set JWT_SECRET=<same-jwt-secret-as-frontend>
  fly secrets set WS_INTERNAL_API_KEY=<generate-random-key>
  fly secrets set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://your-app.vercel.app
```

- [x] Deploy: `fly deploy`
- [x] Add to frontend `.env`:

```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://contenthub-ws.fly.dev
  WS_SERVER_URL=https://contenthub-ws.fly.dev
  WS_INTERNAL_API_KEY=<same-key-as-fly-secret>
```

- [x] For local dev, run `pnpm dev` in `ws-server/` (uses localhost:3001)

**Note:** The WS server is a separate deployment from the Next.js app. It stays on Fly.io even when the frontend moves to Vercel/Aliyun. They communicate via HTTP (server-to-server) and WebSocket (browser-to-server).

## 3. File Upload Deliverables (Aliyun OSS)

### 3.1 OSS Integration

- [x] 3.1.1 `POST /api/upload/presign` with valid fileName/contentType/fileSize → returns `{ presignedUrl, objectKey, publicUrl }`
- [x] 3.1.2 PUT to presignedUrl with file body succeeds (file appears in OSS bucket under `task-attachments/` or `deliverables/`)
- [x] 3.1.3 File metadata stored in task/attempt JSONB fields (url, type, size, name)

## 4. WebSocket Real-Time Updates

### 4.0 Setup & Startup (Local)

Verify WS server is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","connections":0}
```

Open browser console on localhost:3000 — after login you should see:

```
[ws] Connected to real-time server
```

- [x] 4.0.1 WS server starts on port 3001 with `pnpm dev` — console shows `[ws] WebSocket server running on port 3001`
- [x] 4.0.2 `GET http://localhost:3001/health` returns `{"status":"ok","connections":0}`
- [x] 4.0.3 After logging in to the app, browser console shows `[ws] Connected to real-time server`
- [x] 4.0.4 WS server console shows `[ws] Connected: <userId> (<role>)`
- [x] 4.0.5 Navigate to a channel → WS server console shows `[ws] <userId> joined channel:<slug>`

### 4.1 Real-Time Channel Messages (Local)

**Setup:** Open the same channel in two browser tabs logged in as different users (e.g. Tab A = admin, Tab B = creator1).

- [x] 4.1.1 Tab A: send a message → appears instantly in Tab B without refresh
- [x] 4.1.2 Tab B: send a reply → appears instantly in Tab A without refresh
- [x] 4.1.3 Messages are deduplicated — sender sees their own message only once (optimistic append + WS dedup)
- [x] 4.1.4 Open WS server console (local) — confirm `[ws] <userId> joined channel:<slug>` logs for both users

### 4.2 Real-Time System Messages (Local)

**Setup:** Tab A = admin/mod (will perform actions), Tab B = creator (watching channel feed). Open 3-4 browser tabs with different users in the same channel.

- [x] 4.2.1 Admin creates a new task in the channel → system message "New task: [Title]" appears in ALL other tabs in real-time
- [x] 4.2.2 Creator submits an attempt → system message appears in ALL other tabs in real-time
- [x] 4.2.3 Mod approves an attempt → approval system message appears in ALL tabs in that channel in real-time
- [⭕] 4.2.4 Mod rejects an attempt → rejection system message appears only to the submitter in real-time (notification only) - NOT WORKING, NEEDS TO BE FIXED

### 4.3 Real-Time Task Card Updates (Local)

**Setup:** Same multi-tab setup. Watch the task cards in the channel feed.

- [x] 4.3.1 Admin creates a task → task card appears in all other tabs without refresh
- [x] 4.3.2 Creator submits an attempt → attempt count on task card updates in all tabs without refresh (e.g. "1/5 attempts" → "2/5 attempts")
- [x] 4.3.3 Mod approves an attempt → task card status updates to "approved" in all tabs without refresh
- [x] 4.3.4 Mod rejects an attempt → task card refreshes in all tabs (attempt status updated)
- [x] 4.3.5 Create a second task → task card appears in all tabs without refresh (verify consistency after first task)

### 4.4 Real-Time Notifications — Bell Badge (Local)

**Setup:** Tab A = mod (performing review), Tab B = creator (watching their bell icon in navbar), Tab C = another mod (watching their bell icon).

- [x] 4.4.1 Creator submits an attempt → mod's bell badge count increments in Tab A and Tab C without refresh
- [x] 4.4.2 Mod approves creator's attempt → creator's bell badge count increments in Tab B without refresh
- [x] 4.4.3 Mod rejects creator's attempt → creator's bell badge count increments in Tab B without refresh
- [x] 4.4.4 Bell icon turns red/shows count badge when new notification arrives

### 4.5 Real-Time Page Updates (Local)

- [x] 4.5.1 Open Review page in mod's tab → creator submits attempt → review queue updates without refresh
- [x] 4.5.2 Open Notifications page → trigger an action (e.g. approve/reject) → new notification appears without refresh
- [x] 4.5.3 TaskSummaryBar (top of channel) updates counts when task is created/approved
- [x] 4.5.4 System messages show correct timestamps (not "Invalid Date")

### 4.6 Real-Time Wallet Balance (Local)

- [x] 4.6.1 Mod approves an attempt with bounty → creator's wallet balance in navbar updates without refresh
- [x] 4.6.2 Verify the updated balance matches the expected bounty amount

### 4.7 Reconnection & Resilience (Local)

- [x] 4.7.1 Stop the WS server → app still works normally (messages save to DB, just no real-time push)
- [x] 4.7.2 Next.js API logs show no errors (publishes fail silently)
- [x] 4.7.3 Restart the WS server → client auto-reconnects (browser console: `[ws] Connected to real-time server` again)
- [x] 4.7.4 After reconnect, send a message in another tab → first tab receives it (channel room re-joined automatically)
- [x] 4.7.5 Refresh the page → WS reconnects, rejoins channel room
- [x] 4.7.6 Log out → WS disconnects (WS server console: `[ws] Disconnected: <userId>`)
- [x] 4.7.7 Log back in → WS reconnects with new token

### 4.8 Deployed Verification (Fly.io)

- [x] 4.8.1 `GET https://contenthub-ws.fly.dev/health` returns `{"status":"ok",...}`
- [x] 4.8.2 After logging in, browser console shows `[ws] Connected to real-time server` (connecting to Fly.io)
- [x] 4.8.3 If JWT_SECRET mismatch → browser console shows `[ws] Connection error: Invalid token`
- [x] 4.8.4 Repeat 4.1–4.3 key tests — messages, system messages, task card updates via Fly.io
- [x] 4.8.5 Repeat 4.4–4.6 — notifications, page updates, wallet via Fly.io
- [x] 4.8.6 Repeat 4.7.3–4.7.4 — reconnection + auto-rejoin works via Fly.io

---

## 5. Edtech Backend Integration (Self-Test with Simulated Webhooks)

### 5.0 Self-Test Setup

- [x] 5.0.1 Go to https://webhook.site — copy your unique URL
- [x] 5.0.2 Created `backend-task-creator/` Vue app — simulates backend task creation with file uploads to OSS
- [x] 5.0.3 Added CORS support: `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGIN` env var in frontend `.env`, middleware handles preflight
- [x] 5.0.4 Added `GET /api/tasks/sync` endpoint — returns task channels for backend-task-creator dropdown
- [x] 5.0.5 Added Alibaba OSS CORS rule for `http://localhost:5173` (backend-task-creator origin)

### 5.1 Task Sync — Backend Pushing Tasks (Incoming)

**Method:** Use `backend-task-creator` app (`cd backend-task-creator && pnpm dev` → http://localhost:5173) or `pnpm tsx src/scripts/test-sync.ts sync-task`

- [x] 5.1.1 Create a task via backend-task-creator form → task appears in target channel
- [x] 5.1.2 Task card shows in channel feed with correct title, description, bounty
- [x] 5.1.3 System message posted: "New task synced: [Title]"
- [x] 5.1.4 Task card shows purple "SYNCED" badge (`source: 'backend'`)
- [x] 5.1.5 Synced task includes checklist items (visible in submit form)
- [x] 5.1.6 Synced task includes reference attachments (uploaded to OSS via backend-task-creator)
- [x] 5.1.7 Submit with missing required fields → error message shown
- [x] 5.1.8 External ID is auto-generated and stored on the task

### 5.2 Full Round-Trip Test (the key scenario)

- [x] 5.2.1 Sync a task via backend-task-creator (with attachments + checklist)
- [x] 5.2.2 Log in as creator → submit an attempt on the synced task (can see reference attachments + checklist)
- [x] 5.2.3 Check webhook.site → `attempt.submitted` event received with correct payload
- [x] 5.2.4 Run: `pnpm tsx src/scripts/test-sync.ts automod [taskId] [attemptId]` with `status: "rejected"` → attempt rejected, creator notified
- [x] 5.2.5 Creator submits new attempt → second `attempt.submitted` on webhook.site
- [x] 5.2.6 Run automod with `status: "approved"` → system message "Auto-check: approved" but attempt stays "submitted" (pending human review)
- [x] 5.2.7 Log in as mod → approve the attempt
- [x] 5.2.8 Check webhook.site → `task.completed` event received with taskId, userId, bounty
- [x] 5.2.9 Creator's wallet updated, all other attempts auto-rejected

### 5.3 Outgoing Webhook Payload Verification (on webhook.site)

- [x] 5.3.1 `attempt.submitted` payload contains: task_id, attempt_id, user_id, deliverables, timestamp
- [x] 5.3.2 `attempt.submitted` headers contain: `X-Webhook-Event: attempt.submitted`, `X-API-Key`
- [x] 5.3.3 `task.completed` payload contains: task_id, user_id, bounty_usd, bounty_rmb, attempt_id, timestamp
- [x] 5.3.4 `task.completed` headers contain: `X-Webhook-Event: task.completed`, `X-API-Key`
- [x] 5.3.5 Unset `BACKEND_WEBHOOK_URL` → webhooks skipped silently (no errors in logs)

### 5.4 Auto-Mod Review — Simulate Backend QA (Incoming)

- [x] 5.4.1 Auto-reject: system message "Auto-check: rejected — [reason]"
- [x] 5.4.2 Auto-approve: system message "Auto-check: approved (confidence: X%)" — attempt stays "submitted"
- [x] 5.4.3 Invalid task/attempt ID → 404
- [x] 5.4.4 Invalid API key → 401

### 5.5 Handoff to Backend Team (after all self-tests pass)

- [x] 5.5.1 Prepare API spec doc with exact endpoints, payloads, headers, auth
- [x] 5.5.2 Include webhook.site screenshots as payload examples
- [x] 5.5.3 Share with backend team — ask for: (1) their webhook receiver URL, (2) agreed API key, (3) auto-QA plans
- [ ] 5.5.5 Re-run round-trip test with real backend
