# P4 Manual Testing Plan — Training/Test System (LLM-Powered AI Tutor)

## P4 Strategy

**Build order:** Database Schema → Admin Lesson Dashboard → Admin Lesson Editor (Prompts/Test/Settings) → LLM Integration (adapt trainingllm) → Learner Welcome & Lesson List → Learner AI Tutor Chat → Learner Deterministic Test → Tag Award & Progression → Upload Review Queue → Anti-Cheat → WebSocket → Edge Cases & Polish

**Why this order?** Schema underpins everything. Admin CRUD comes first so there is data to test learner flows against. The LLM chat code already works in `trainingllm/` and gets adapted after the editor is functional. Upload review is last because it depends on learners reaching the test stage and submitting uploads.

**LLM integration:** Adapt the working 2-pass architecture from `trainingllm/backend/lib/llm.ts` and `trainingllm/backend/pages/api/chat/reply.ts`. The core flow (Call A open, Call B reply, structured JSON response, attempt tracking, anti-cheat flags) is proven. Port to Next.js API routes and React components.

**Training UI:** The learner experience lives inside the `#beginner-training` channel — chat-based, like a Discord bot. Lesson list, AI tutor chat, and test all render within the channel view.

**Self-testing approach:** Use the existing LLM endpoint from `trainingllm/.env` (OpenAI-compatible, Qwen3 via iflow.cn) for AI tutor testing. Upload review can be tested with dummy files before OSS integration. Tag webhook tested via webhook.site as in P2.

## Prerequisites

### Already Set Up (from P0-P3)

- App running on localhost:3000
- Default admin: `admin@creatorhub.local` / `admin123`
- Test accounts: creator1, mod1, supermod1 (promoted via Settings > Admin > Users)
- `#beginner-training` channel exists in seed data (special channel)
- Tag system functional (tags table, userTags table, channel gating via requiredTagId)
- OSS upload infrastructure from P2
- WebSocket server from P2

### New Setup Required for P4

#### 1. LLM API Credentials

- [ ] Copy LLM credentials from `trainingllm/.env` into frontend `.env`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.iflow.cn/v1
OPENAI_MODEL=qwen3-max
```

- [ ] Verify LLM connectivity: `curl -X POST $OPENAI_BASE_URL/chat/completions -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"model":"qwen3-max","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hello"}]}'`

#### 2. Database Migration

- [x] Add P4 tables to schema and run `pnpm drizzle-kit push`
- [x] Verify tables exist: `lessons`, `trainer_prompts`, `tests`, `test_questions`, `user_progress`, `upload_submissions`

#### 3. Seed Data

- [ ] Create at least 2 tags for training: `viral_video_hooks`, `retention_pacing`
- [ ] Ensure `#beginner-training` channel exists (already in seed)
- [ ] Optionally create a tag-gated task channel (e.g. `#viral-tasks` requiring `viral_video_hooks` tag) for prerequisite chain testing

- [x] 9.1.2 Client created following pattern from `trainingllm/backend/lib/llm.ts`
- [x] 9.1.3 If env vars missing → clear error in logs: "LLM not configured — training features disabled"

### 9.2 Call Type A (Open) — from `trainingllm/backend/pages/api/chat/open.ts`

- [x] 9.2.1 Accepts: lessonId, promptIndex, optional previousResult context
- [x] 9.2.2 Loads TrainerPrompt markdown from database (not flat file like trainingllm)
- [x] 9.2.3 System prompt: enthusiastic tutor, NEVER reveal the answer, follow trainer prompt sections
- [x] 9.2.4 Returns: `{ message: string }` (teacher's opening)
- [ ] 9.2.5 Extracts `oss://` URLs from markdown before sending to LLM (LLM gets text descriptions)

### 9.4 Welcome & Congratulatory Messages

- [x] 9.4.1 Welcome call: accepts user name + progress summary → returns personalized welcome
- [x] 9.4.2 Congratulatory call: accepts user name + lesson title + score → returns celebration message

### 9.5 LLM Error Handling

- [x] 9.5.1 API timeout (>30s) → "AI tutor temporarily unavailable. Please try again."
- [x] 9.5.2 Rate limit (429) → "Too many requests. Please wait a moment."
- [x] 9.5.3 Invalid API key → 500 with admin-visible error, user sees generic message

- [x] 10.1.3 LLM never reveals answer when cheating detected (enforced by system prompt)
- [x] 10.1.4 Cheating response includes a warning from the teacher

### 10.2 Cheating Handling (App-Side)

- [x] 10.2.1 Cheating attempts do NOT increment the attempt counter
- [x] 10.2.2 `cheatingWarnings` counter incremented in UserProgress
- [x] 10.2.3 First offense: warning message displayed
- [x] 10.2.4 Second offense: stronger warning ("Further attempts may result in ban")
- [x] 10.2.5 Cheating warnings visible to mods in Upload Review queue

### 10.3 Random Guessing Detection

- [x] 10.3.1 Gibberish/random text → `student_is_just_random_guessing: true`
- [x] 10.3.2 Random guessing IS counted as an attempt (unlike cheating)
- [x] 10.3.3 Bot responds: "That doesn't seem like a real answer. Try thinking about..."

### 10.4 Attempt Tracking Integrity

- [x] 10.4.1 Attempt count tracked in app state AND persisted to UserProgress.attempts
- [x] 10.4.2 Client-side count matches server-side (no reset by refreshing)

---

## 12. Prerequisite Chains

### 12.1 Linear Prerequisite Chain

- [ ] 12.1.1 Create 3 lessons: L1 (no prereq, awards tag A), L2 (requires tag A, awards tag B), L3 (requires tag B, awards tag C)
- [ ] 12.1.2 New user sees: L1 available, L2 locked ("Requires: A"), L3 locked ("Requires: B")
- [ ] 12.1.3 User passes L1 → earns tag A → L2 becomes available, L3 still locked
- [ ] 12.1.4 User passes L2 → earns tag B → L3 becomes available
- [ ] 12.1.5 User passes L3 → all 3 shown as completed

### 12.2 Channel Gating via Tags

- [ ] 12.2.1 Channel with `requiredTagId = tag A` hidden from users without tag A
