- [x] 4.2.3 Filing an appeal triggers an **unread badge** on #appeals for all mods/supermods/admins

## 5. 48-Hour Lock Mechanism

- [x] 5.2.5 Timer updates in real-time (every minute refresh or JS countdown)

### 5.3 Lock Resolution

- [x] 5.3.1 Creator submits revision → mod reviews → can Approve (LOCKED → APPROVED) or Reject
- [x] 5.3.2 If mod rejects during lock → task stays LOCKED, creator can try again (within 48h)
- [x] 5.3.3 Lock expires (48h passes) → next task query auto-transitions LOCKED → ACTIVE
- [x] 5.3.4 After auto-unlock: task open for everyone again, system message: "Lock expired — task reopened"
- [x] 5.3.5 Mod can manually unlock early → LOCKED → ACTIVE, system message: "Task unlocked by [mod]"

### 5.4 Lock Expiry Check (Lazy Evaluation)

- [x] 5.4.1 `GET /api/tasks` checks any LOCKED tasks where `lockExpiresAt < now()` → auto-updates to ACTIVE
- [x] 5.4.2 Channel page load also triggers the lazy check
- [x] 5.4.3 No cron job needed — expiry resolved on next read
- [x] 5.4.4 After auto-unlock, lockedById and lockExpiresAt are cleared
